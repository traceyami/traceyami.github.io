# Personal Website Project

## File Structure
- `index.html` - The live site (copy of latest version)
- `versions/` - Saved checkpoints (v1, v2, etc.)
- `images/` - All images
- `prototypes/` - Working/test files (not pushed to GitHub)
- `archive/` - Old unused files (not pushed)

## Workflow
1. Work in a prototype file (e.g., `prototypes/layout-test.html`)
2. When happy with a checkpoint, save as new version (e.g., `versions/v6.html`)
3. When ready to deploy, copy version to `index.html`
4. Commit and push

## GitHub Pages
- Repo: traceyami/traceyami.github.io
- URL: https://traceyami.github.io
- Only `index.html`, `versions/`, and `images/` are pushed

## Current Version
v5 - Bento grid with card fan, flamingo/owl stack, boobies corner
