# Personal Website Design Ideas

## Current State: v2.html

## Text Cells
- Use Caveat (hand-drawn font) for labels ("Work", "About", "Just for Fun")
- Subtle paper grain/noise texture overlay
- Hover states (warmth shift, slight lift)
- Better hierarchy — labels as a whisper, content more prominent

## Empty Cells (Animation)
- Tiny pigeon that occasionally waddles across
- Crab's eyes that blink or follow cursor
- Subtle floating card suit symbols (♠ ♥ ♦ ♣)
- A pen that draws a small doodle loop
- Keep it ambient, not attention-grabbing — delightful on discovery

## Card Display
- Fan out 3-5 cards with Queen as focal point
- Hover: fan spreads wider or lifts
- Optional slow auto-animation (cards subtly shifting)
- Communicates "this is a deck" not just one card

## Craft Details
- Detail crop cell showing hand-drawn linework/texture
- Hover state on Queen that zooms into illustration quality
- Show the care that went into the cards

## Footer
- Add personality to links
- Small animations or hand-written styling
- It's the last impression

## Guiding Principle
"Everything here was made with intention" — every hover, every detail, every quiet animation should feel considered. Avoid over-animating (tech demo vs. personal portfolio).
